# Write a function word_unscrambler that takes two inputs: a scrambled
# word and a dictionary of real words.  Your program must then output
# all words that our scrambled word can unscramble to.
#
# Hint: To see if a string `s1` is an anagram of `s2`, split both
# strings into arrays of letters. Sort the two arrays. If they are
# equal, then they are anagrams.
#
# Difficulty: 3/5

def word_unscrambler(str, words)
  all_words = []

  words.each do |word|
    all_words << word if str.split("").sort == word.split("").sort
  end

  all_words
end
